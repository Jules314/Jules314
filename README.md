##Welcome to My Cybersecurity Joruney



## About Me 

Hey,I am Juliana! I am currently a cybersecurity student who is curious about exploring various career paths within my major. This repository is a space for me to document my learning journey, share resources, and reflect on my experiences. I plan to share projects that I did in class and built on as well as current projects outside of that. 

## Learning Paths I am Curious About...

- GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance): Principles and best practices of cybersecurity governance, risk management, and compliance to build a solid foundation in protecting organizations and managing risks.
- Network Administration: Exploring the critical aspects of maintaining and securing network infrastructures with hands-on experience using layer 2 Cisco switches.
- Cloud Security: Understanding cloud environments and how to secure services, a growing area in today's digital landscape.

## The Goal:

Through this repository, I aim to not only track my progress but also share my knowledge with others in the cybersecurity community. Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!
